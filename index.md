Daniele is an aspiring software craftsman with more that ten years of experience in the software industry. He is currently a consultant in the .Net space for a big insurance company, and previously worked in the manufacturing industry. He has experience with C#, Java, C++, PHP, Javascript, and lately has added some F# to the sauce.

He constantly annoys his friends by talking about software and is passionate about Agile methodologies, which gives him more opportunities to annoy his friends even more.
