#Who Am I
I’m a software developer who believe in improving constantly and sharing the knowledge to help the whole community grow, that’s why this year I lead two bootcamps introducing functional programming with F#, presented at two conferences on the topic of DevOps with Visual Studio Team Services and Azure, and also facilitated a local coderetreat for the Global Day of Coderetreat. 

I currently work as a consultant for an big insurance company as a maintainer of an internal web Application. One of my objectives in these two years was to payback the technical debt that has accumulated over the years in this product while adding new functionality to it. I'm also leading the introduction of Scrum in our team which has had an incredible effect in the quality of the software we produce. 

Technology wise I consider myself what Kent Beck calls a Paint Drip Person as I like to learn new languages and technologies every now and then and then dig deeper into a few of them. My main competency is in the .Net space, specifically in web web development with Framework 4+, I love F# and try to use it whenever I can and now I’m digging deeper into dotnet core as I’m going to give a talk about it to a Linux User Group.

### Recent Open Source Contributions
 
When I have time I like to give some to the Open Source community, which is why I also participated in some Open Source projects the more interesting of which is the [Humanitarian ToolBox](https://github.com/HTBox) 

* [allReady](https://github.com/HTBox/allReady): Solution focused on increasing awareness, efficiency and impact of preparedness campaigns as they are delivered by humanitarian and disaster response organizations in local communities

* [Debonair](https://github.com/JamesStuddart/debonair): Very light weight ORM, that does not contain object tracking, it does not support child objects. Its back to basics, Keep It Simple Stupid.
